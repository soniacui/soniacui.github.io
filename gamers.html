            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>gaming app</p>
            <h4>Team</h4>
            <p>I tackled this project by myself!</p>
            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p>idea, UI/UX</p>
            <h4>Timeline</h4>
            <p>Dec. 2020 - Jan. 2021 (4 weeks)</p>
            <h4>Tools</h4>
            <p>Figma, Photoshop</p>

            <br />

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p> With everyone staying at home due to the unfortunate COVID-19, gaming has become more popular than ever
                as a means to pass time and bond with others. However, it can be
                <span class="highlight">difficult to find people to play games with.</span>
                Friends aren't always free, or want to play the same games as you, or the same skill level as you.
            </p>

            <h4>Goal</h4>
            <p><span class="highlight">Create an efficient and practical way to help people to meet others through
                    games</span></p>

            <br />

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4>Primary Research</h4>
            <p>I conducted surveys and interviews to dive deeper into understanding how gamers currently look for gaming
                companions, what exactly they look for, and what they find difficult about the process.

            <h5>Insights</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>People mainly find people to play games with through Discord, current friends, or mutual friends
                </li>
                <li>The most important factors when looking for someone to play games with are availability,
                    shared interests, and skill level
                </li>
                <li>The main obstacles to finding people to play games with are differing schedules, skill levels,
                    or differing intentions with the game (e.g. casual vs. serious)
                </li>
            </ol>

            </p>

            <h5>Pain Points</h5>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    People have differing schedules <br />
                    Everybody's busy with something, and can't always play at a moment's notice. People often have
                    different
                    sleep schedules, or have school/work deadlines. It's especially to sync up a good time for games
                    that
                    require more people, such as Among Us. This was the #1 complaint about finding people to play with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Friends may have different skill levels <br />
                    Even if a few friends are free at the same time and both love the same game, they might not be able
                    to play well together.
                    For example, in League of Legends, a person ranked very highly at Diamond cannot play ranked with
                    someone ranked much lower
                    at Bronze. They could play casually, but the skill gap may make the game feel too easy or too
                    difficult for either player.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Interests and personalities need to align <br />
                    Friends might not play the same games, or may have different goals within the game (e.g. casual vs.
                    serious).
                    For example, some people don't play shooters because it makes them dizzy, some people only play
                    adventure games, or
                    some people only want to play ranked.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>The Redesign</h3>


            <h4>The Concept</h4>
            A Discord extension that allows people to search for public servers - they can search by game
            and see mutuals already in the server. There will also be a new 'Events' type channel in
            each server to create events.
            #1 complaint was availability -> vote for meetups ahead of time so people can easily decide
            a time, and make time for it
            #2 complaint was similar personality/intentions w the game -> people can join game-specific servers
            that match their goals (e.g. diamond+, sweaty, casual, etc...)
            #3 complaint was skill level -> people can join game-specific servers that meet their skill level
            (e.g. diamond+, plat+, ...)


            I decided to with concept 2 because it seemed more practical - 89% of gamers already
            use Discord, so it would be smarter to build on top of something that people already use.
            I can take advantage of the fact that people connect through already-existing mutuals on
            Discord, and that they're already used to the UI.
            Traditionally, Discord servers are private and require and invitation to join. However,
            there are thousands of servers meant to have as many people as possible, such Toronto
            Pokemon Go servers, Among Us servers, and many more...
            And Beyond is a discord extension that will allow users to search beyond their
            the users' private servers to discover public servers for the games and people they desire!
            Great way to find people to play games with & meet new people

            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            Since I'm creating a Discord extension, I need to make sure my tone and design match Discord's.
            I chose typeface Segoe UI, identical to Discord's own font, and followed their colour palette
            and tone throughout the design process.

                    3. Public servers have specific EVENT channels to make it easier to
                    host events
                    Like a regular text channel to discuss the upcoming event, but also a
                    poll that allows users to vote for the event time to maximize the # of people who
                    can come - availability was the #1 complaint in user surveys.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    learned that designing for users is very different from designing for yourself
                </li>
                <li>
                    user responses in surveys/interviews were not always what i expected - keeps me aware of my biases
                    could've been less biased in the survey
                </li>

            </ol>
            <h4>For the future...</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    update poll for time in events tab
                </li>
                <li>
                    thorough user testing (i tested with 2 users, could've done a lot more)
                </li>

            </ol>
