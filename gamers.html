                            Everybody's busy with something, and can't always play at a moment's notice. People often

                            different
                            sleep schedules, or have school/work deadlines. It's especially to sync up a good time for
                            games
                            that
                            require more people, such as Among Us. This was the #1 complaint about finding people to

                            with.</p>

                            able
                            to play well together.
                            For example, in League of Legends, a person ranked very highly at Diamond cannot play ranked
                            with
                            someone ranked much lower
                            at Bronze. They could play casually, but the skill gap may make the game feel too easy or
                            too
                            difficult for either player.

                            adventure games, or

                <h4>The Concept</h4> 
            </div>
            <div class="row indent section">
                <p>A discord extension that allows users to find public servers, filtered by interest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row indent section">
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>Justification</h4>
                    Traditionally, Discord servers are private and require and invitation to join. However,
                    there are thousands of servers meant to have as many people as possible, such Toronto
                    Pokemon Go servers, Among Us servers, and many more...
                    And Beyond is a discord extension that will allow users to search beyond their
                    the users' private servers to discover public servers for the games and people they desire!
                    240 million Discord users - high reach; most gamers already have it -> network of mutuals
                </div>

                <div class="col">

                    <h4>Key Features</h4>


                    search by game
                    Searching by game will help narrow down the server results - most users will have a few
                    games in mind that they want to play.

                    narrow by interest/skill level
                    The #2 obstacle to finding people to play games with was differing interests or skill level within
                    the game (e.g. casual vs. serious). After filtering for the game they want, the user can
                    choose among various servers depending on game interest/goal, and see mutuals already
                    in the server.

                    events channel to vote for availability
                    The #1 obstacle to finding people to play games with was availability. With this extension,
                    servers will have a built-in 'events' channel, in which people can vote for a time
                    that they're free to meet up. Furthermore, the event time will be scheduled ahead of time,
                    so people will be more likely to make time for it.

                Since I'm creating a Discord extension, I need to make sure my tone and design match Discord's.
                The typeface I chose is Segoe UI, which is identical to Discord's actual font. I made sure to
                match Discord's casual tone and dark colour palette throughout designing.

                    3. Public servers have specific EVENT channels to make it easier to
                    host events
                    Like a regular text channel to discuss the upcoming event, but also a
                    poll that allows users to vote for the event time to maximize the # of people who
                    can come - availability was the #1 complaint in user surveys.
