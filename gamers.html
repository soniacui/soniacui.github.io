                <p> With everyone staying at home due to the unfortunate COVID-19, gaming has become more popular than
                    ever
                    as a means to pass time and bond with others. However, it can be

                <p>I conducted surveys and interviews to dive deeper into understanding how gamers currently look for
                    gaming
                    companions, what exactly they look for, and what they find difficult about the process.

                <p>The main patterns I noticed among the feedback were:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>People mainly find people to play games with through Discord, current friends, or mutual
                        friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>The most important factors when looking for someone to play games with are availability,
                        shared interests, and skill level.
                    </li>
                    <li>The main obstacles to finding people to play games with are differing schedules, skill levels,
                        or differing intentions with the game (e.g. casual vs. serious).

                <p>Among the survey and interview feedback, these were the top 3 concerns I discovered: </p> <br />

                        People have differing schedules <br />
                        <p class="regular">
                            Everybody's busy with something, and can't always play at a moment's notice. People often
                            have
                            different
                            sleep schedules, or have school/work deadlines. It's especially to sync up a good time for
                            games
                            that
                            require more people, such as Among Us. This was the #1 complaint about finding people to
                            play
                            with.</p>

                            Even if a few friends are free at the same time and both love the same game, they might not
                            be
                            able
                            to play well together.
                            For example, in League of Legends, a person ranked very highly at Diamond cannot play ranked
                            with
                            someone ranked much lower
                            at Bronze. They could play casually, but the skill gap may make the game feel too easy or
                            too
                            difficult for either player.

                            vs.
                            serious).
                            For example, some people don't play shooters because it makes them dizzy, some people only
                            play
                            adventure games, or

                <p>Discord has over 100 million regular users - most gamers already use Discord.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, Discord servers are private and require and invitation to join. However,
                    this is a waste of potential for servers that are meant to be discovered. For example,
                    Toronto Pokemon Go servers, Among Us servers, and many more are constantly ushering in
                    more people!

                    And Beyond is a discord extension that will allow users to search beyond their
                    private servers to discover new gaming communities that they click with!

                    Searching by game will help narrow down the server results - most users will have a few

                    The #2 obstacle to finding people to play games with was differing interests or skill level within
                    the game (e.g. casual vs. serious). After filtering for the game they want, the user can
                    choose among various servers depending on game interest/goal, and see mutuals already
                    in the server.

                    The #1 obstacle to finding people to play games with was availability. With this extension,
                    servers will have a built-in 'events' channel, in which people can vote for a time
                    that they're free to meet up. Furthermore, the event time will be scheduled ahead of time,
                    so people will be more likely to make time for it.

                Since I'm creating a Discord extension, I want to make sure my tone and design match Discord's.
                The typeface I chose is Segoe UI, which is identical to Discord's actual font. I made sure to
                match Discord's casual tone and dark colour palette throughout designing.

                    Users can also see mutual friends within each server, which gives them incentive to join.

                    Public servers have new 'event' channels to help organize availability.
                    In an 'event' channel, users can vote for the time they want the event to be depending on
                    when they're free, and also discuss the upcoming festivities. <br />
                    This addresses the #1 complaint during user research - availability.

                        <p class="regular">
                            Throughout the design process, I found myself wondering how I should
                            design the functionality of various features. My automatic reaction
                            was to think, "What do I want?", but I know that I'm not designing for
                            myself. I learned to keep research feedback at the front of my mind
                            when designing, and ask for other people's feedback when stuck.

                        <p class="regular">
                            Looking back, there was a bit of bias in my survey questions. For example,
                            asking 'How
                            <span class="italics">easy</span> is it for you to find people to play games with?' may
                            imply
                            that the process is supposed to be easy. Furthermore, giving users limited
                            answers to choose from may only give me parts of the whole story. Next time,
                            I'll be more wary of potential biases when designing user surveys.

                            I tested with two sample users, but I should collect more information
