                    than ever to meet new people and make friends. Since the lockdown, more and more
                    people have been turning to games like Among Us as a means to pass time and bond with others.
                    However, friends aren't always free to game, or don't enjoy playing the same games.
                    Lockdown can be lonely and right now

                            Everybody's busy with something, and can't always play at a moment's notice. People often

                            different
                            sleep schedules, or have school/work deadlines. It's especially to sync up a good time for
                            games
                            that
                            require more people, such as Among Us. This was the #1 complaint about finding people to

                            Even if a few friends are free at the same time and both love the same game, they might not

                            able
                            to play well together.
                            For example, in League of Legends, a person ranked very highly at Diamond cannot play ranked
                            with
                            someone ranked much lower
                            at Bronze. They could play casually, but the skill gap may make the game feel too easy or
                            too
                            difficult for either player.

                            adventure games, or

                    they can filter by interests.
                    Traditionally, Discord servers are private and require and invitation to join. However,
                    this is a waste of potential for servers that are meant to be discovered. For example,
                    Toronto Pokemon Go servers, Among Us servers, and many more are constantly looking
                    for new people to join them.
                </p>
                <p> I decided to choose the Discord extension because its high user base makes it super
                    practical if the goal is to connect people. Discord has over 100 million regular users,
                    and most gamers already use Discord.
                    I want to take advantage of its large user base to build on top of what it already does well. </p>

                    Searching by game will help narrow down the server results - most users will have a few
                    games in mind that they want to play.

                    The #2 obstacle to finding people to play games with was differing interests or skill level within
                    the game (e.g. casual vs. serious). After filtering for the game they want, the user can
                    choose among various servers depending on game interest/goal, and see mutuals already
                    in the server.

                    The #1 obstacle to finding people to play games with was availability. With this extension,
                    servers will have a built-in 'events' channel, in which people can vote for a time
                    that they're free to meet up. Furthermore, the event time will be scheduled ahead of time,
                    so people will be more likely to make time for it.

                Since I'm creating a Discord extension, I want to make sure its design matches
                Discord's existing design system.
                I created the style guide below to help guide me when designing the prototypes.
                The typeface I chose is Segoe UI, which is identical to Discord's actual font.
                I also followed Discord's colour palette, which mainly consists of darks and grays.
                I also kept in mind that Discord has a more casual tone.

                            Throughout the design process, I found myself wondering how I should
                            design the functionality of various features. I would often refer
                            to the initial feedback I got from survey and interviews, 
                            but after I built the prototypes, I found that some user opinions changed. 
                            My initial designs veered from solving the original problem, and
                            if I sought feedback earlier, I could've prevented this
                            and gotten back on track faster.

                            Looking back, there was a bit of bias in my survey questions. For example,
                            asking 'How
                            <span class="italics">easy</span> is it for you to find people to play games with?' may
                            imply
                            that the process is supposed to be easy. Additionally, giving users limited
                            answers to choose from may only give me parts of the whole story. In future
                            iterations, I'll be careful to avoid biases when asking for user feedback.
